## Installation
This app requires the NPM installation of console.table, express, inquirer, and mysql2. Please make sure to enter your own information where indicated.
## Usage
VIDEO HERE.
## Future Development
I would like to get rid of inquirer entirely in favor of a front end to the application, in addition to more search and organizational features that the front end would make easier to implement.
